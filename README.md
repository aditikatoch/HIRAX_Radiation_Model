# High Resolution Astronomy with X-Rays (HIRAX) Spacecraft Radiation Model

The HIgh-Resolution Astronomy with X-rays mission, HIRAX was conceptualised at the University of Leicester as part of the research phase for the Space Exploration Systems MSc program. It involved a six- month comprehensive feasibility study for an M-class space X-ray interferometer mission with the capability of micro-arcsecond-level resolution in the soft X-ray energy band. The sub-systems directly affecting the science goals and objective of the instrument were studied as part of a feasibility study. 

The shielding and protection sub-system was a part of the thermomechanical work package for HIRAX spacecraft and was conceptualised using first principles and ECSS standards. Only the detectors where considered for shielding against the focused X-Ray background and particulate radiation. Validation models in form of box and sphere models where constructed for the full spacecraft model results verification.
